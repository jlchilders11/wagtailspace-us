Wagtail Space
=============

Wagtail Space is a Wagtail event hosted by Four Digits in Arnhem, The Netherlands.

We like others to organise Wagtail Space events as well.

If you like to organise a Wagtail meet up, sprint or conference you may use the Wagtail Space name, graphics and website!

What we propose:

    - Name your Wagtail event: 'Wagtail Space [CityName]'. Eg: 'Wagtail Space Philadelphia'.
    - Notify Four Digits and get a subdomain (philadelphia.wagtail.space)
    - We list your event on [wagtail.space](https://wagtail.space)
    - Provide hosting yourself (supply an ip address)
    - Notify Wagtail Core team of your event plans
